   abstract = {In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences published a report questioning the scientific validity of many forensic methods including firearm examination. Firearm examination is a forensic tool used to help the court determine whether two bullets were fired from the same gun barrel. During the firing process, rifling, manufacturing defects, and impurities in the barrel create striation marks on the bullet. Identifying these striation markings in an attempt to match two bullets is one of the primary goals of firearm examination. We propose an automated framework for the analysis of the 3D surface measurements of bullet land impressions which transcribes the individual characteristics into a set of features that quantify their similarities. This makes identification of matches easier and allows for a quantification of both matches and matchability of barrels. The automatic matching routine we propose manages to (a) correctly identify land impressions (the surface between two bullet groove impressions) with too much damage to be suitable for comparison, and (b) correctly identify all 10,384 land-to-land matches of the James Hamby study.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in microscopy have made it possible to collect 3D topographic data, enabling more precise virtual comparisons based on the collected 3D data as a supplement to traditional comparison microscopy and 2D photography. Automatic comparison algorithms have been introduced for various scenarios, such as matching cartridge cases [1,2] or matching bullet striae [3–5]. One key aspect of validating these automatic comparison algorithms is to evaluate the performance of the algorithm on external tests, that is, using data which were not used to train the algorithm. Here, we present a discussion of the performance of the matching algorithm [6] in three studies conducted using different Ruger weapons. We consider the performance of three scoring measures: random forest score, cross correlation, and consecutive matching striae (CMS) at the land-to-land level and, using Sequential Average Maxima scores, also at the bullet-to bullet level. Cross correlation and random forest scores both result in perfect discrimination of same-source and different-source bullets. At the land-to-land level, discrimination for both cross correlation and random forest scores (based on area under the curve, AUC) is excellent (≥0.90).},

   abstract = {In 2016, the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) published guidelines for the evaluation, interpretation and reporting of scientific evidence. In the guidelines, ENFSI endorsed the use of the likelihood ratio (LR) as a means to represent the probative value of most types of evidence. While computing the value of a LR is practical in several forensic disciplines, calculating an LR for pattern evidence such as fingerprints, firearm and other toolmarks is particularly challenging because standard statistical approaches are not applicable. Recent research suggests that machine learning algorithms can summarize a potentially large set of features into a single score which can then be used to quantify the similarity between pattern samples. It is then possible to compute a score-based likelihood ratio (SLR) and obtain an approximation to the value of the evidence, but research has shown that the SLR can be quite different from the LR not only in size but also in direction. We provide theoretical and empirical arguments that under reasonable assumptions, the SLR can be a practical tool for forensic evaluations.},

   abstract = {Land engraved areas (LEAs) provide evidence to address the same source–different source problem in forensic firearms examination. Collecting 3D images of bullet LEAs requires capturing portions of the neighboring groove engraved areas (GEAs). Analyzing LEA and GEA data separately is imperative to accuracy in automated comparison methods such as the one developed by Hare et al. (Ann Appl Stat 2017;11, 2332). Existing standard statistical modeling techniques often fail to adequately separate LEA and GEA data due to the atypical structure of 3D bullet data. We developed a method for automated removal of GEA data based on robust locally weighted regression (LOESS). This automated method was tested on high-resolution 3D scans of LEAs from two bullet test sets with a total of 622 LEA scans. Our robust LOESS method outperforms a previously proposed “rollapply” method. We conclude that our method is a major improvement upon rollapply, but that further validation needs to be conducted before the method can be applied in a fully automated fashion.},

The Hamby datasets 44 and 252 measured by NIST and CSAFE (high-resolution scans) are used here. We provide methods to identify parameters that minimize error rates for matching of LEAs, and a remedial algorithm to alleviate the problem of failed tests, while increasing the power of the test and reducing error rates. For 85,491 land-to-land comparisons (84,235 known nonmatches and 1256 known matches), the adapted test does not provide a result in 176 situations (originally more than 500). The Type I and Type II error rates are 7.2% (6105 out of 84,235) and 21.4% (271 out of 1256), respectively. This puts the proposed method on similar footing as other single-feature matching approaches in the literature.},

   abstract = {Estimating error rates for firearm evidence identification is a fundamental challenge in forensic science. This paper describes the recently developed congruent matching cells (CMC) method for image comparisons, its application to firearm evidence identification, and its usage and initial tests for error rate estimation. The CMC method divides compared topography images into correlation cells. Four identification parameters are defined for quantifying both the topography similarity of the correlated cell pairs and the pattern congruency of the registered cell locations. A declared match requires a significant number of CMCs, i.e., cell pairs that meet all similarity and congruency requirements. Initial testing on breech face impressions of a set of 40 cartridge cases fired with consecutively manufactured pistol slides showed wide separation between the distributions of CMC numbers observed for known matching and known non-matching image pairs. Another test on 95 cartridge cases from a different set of slides manufactured by the same process also yielded widely separated distributions. The test results were used to develop two statistical models for the probability mass function of CMC correlation scores. The models were applied to develop a framework for estimating cumulative false positive and false negative error rates and individual error rates of declared matches and non-matches for this population of breech face impressions. The prospect for applying the models to large populations and realistic case work is also discussed. The CMC method can provide a statistical foundation for estimating error rates in firearm evidence identifications, thus emulating methods used for forensic identification of DNA evidence.},

   abstract = {We introduce the Congruent Matching Profile Segments (CMPS) method for objective comparison of striated tool marks and apply it to bullet signature correlations. The method is derived from the congruent matching cell (CMC) method developed for the comparison of impressed tool marks. The proposed method is designed to increase comparison accuracy by addressing the comparison challenges caused by striae profiles with different lateral scales, varying vertical (height) scales, and sections that are poorly marked or have little to no similarity. Instead of correlating the entire profiles extracted from striated tool marks, the method divides one of the compared profiles into segments. Each segment is then correlated with the other profile. The CMPS method uses the normalized cross-correlation function with multiple correlation peak inspection to determine the number of profile segments that have both significant topography similarity and a congruent registration position. Initial tests were performed on the land engraved areas (LEAs) of 35 bullets fired from 10 consecutively manufactured pistol barrels. The results show clear separation between the CMPS scores of the 549 known non-matching (KNM) LEA profiles and the 46 known matching (KM) LEA profiles. These results are an improvement over those obtained using the correlation coefficient score of whole profiles. The large number of CMPS segment correlations may facilitate a statistical approach to error rate estimations.},

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators.},

The proposed CMC method can be used for correlation of both geometrical topographies and optical images. The “congruent matching” method can be potentially applied for all case scenarios of fired cartridge cases, fired bullets, and toolmarks. The CMC parameters and algorithms are in the public domain and subject to open tests. High-speed correlations are ensured by “synchronous processing” of multiple correlation cell pairs at the same time. Based on the CMC method, an error rate procedure is proposed for establishing a statistical foundation to support nationwide ballistics identifications in forensic science, and to provide an error rate report for court proceedings in a manner similar to the method used for reporting the Coincidental (Random) Match Probability (CMP) in forensic identification of DNA evidences.},

The cross-correlation maximum is the functional parameter used to quantify similarity. A second parameter, called the relative profile (2D) difference or relative areal topography (3D) difference, may also be used to quantify differences and to recognize the ambiguous condition when two results have different vertical (z-) scales but identical shapes. Most of these examples have been applied in support of ballistics inspection methods in crime labs, but the methods are generally useful for estimating the accuracy of surface replication techniques or the ability of different surface topography instruments to measure the same surface and provide the same result. The instruments used in these studies were a stylus instrument and a Nipkow-disk type confocal microscope.
